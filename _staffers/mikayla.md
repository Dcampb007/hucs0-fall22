I graduated from Howard University in 2021 with a bachelors degree in Computer Science. I am a software engineer at Google, implementing new features for the [Google Maps website](https://www.maps.google.com), Before coming to Google fulltime, I interned at a small consulting company in Atlanta, interned at Google twice,and participated in Google's Tech Exchange program. I'm super excited to be back in Washington DC teaching at my alma mater this fall. I love dedicating my time to improving education in my community, and learning more about education policy both at the K-12 level and higher learning level. In my free time I like to go to run, play golf, and watch anime here and there :)
