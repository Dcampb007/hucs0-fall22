### Some Extra Resources
Hey y'all! Just wanted to share some extra resources that may be helpful for you.

- If you haven't done so already, make sure you create a [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/). It's a professional networking site that will help you in your career presence online. Here's some [tips](https://shorelight.com/student-stories/how-to-use-linkedin-effectively-as-a-college-student/) to help you get started on making a good account

- Once you've done that, make sure you join the [Intro to CS Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14577075/) so you can get extra resources!

- I'm having [office hours](https://calendar.app.google/uyW4MUiTZb6nSEcP8
) on Monday and Friday starting January 6th! You can chat with me virtually during this time to talk/ask about anything you like. **If you need a mock interview with me, please email me directly at mikayladorange@gmail.com** Mock interviews will also start January 6th.
